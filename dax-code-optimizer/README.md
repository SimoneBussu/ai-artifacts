# ðŸ”„ DAX Code Optimizer

This Artifact, made with Claude AI, analyzes your Power BI DAX code and provides optimization suggestions based on Microsoft's official best practices. It helps improve performance, readability, and maintainability of your DAX formulas.

My goal was to build a tool that not only would detect inefficient code, but a tool that would also serve an educational purpose.

# Example

Here is an example. Consider the following measure that want to compute the total sales only for the product category "Electronics".

```dax
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        Products,
        Products[Category] = "Electronics"
    )
)
```

Paste the code and click on "Analyze & Optimize".

Then in the bottom part of the app, in the "Optimized Code" tab, you will see the reviewed code.
