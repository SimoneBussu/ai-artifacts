# üá´üá∑ French Learning Assistant

This Artifact, made with Claude AI, analyzes and corrects an input text in French. It provides the corrected version and an explanation for each correction.
You can select your mother tongue, English or Italian, and the level of language formality you need, formal or daily.

My goal was to build a tool that would help people in their French language learning journey.

Then, you can select in the dropdown list your mother tongue (in this example English / _Anglais_) and the level of formality you want to be applied to the text (in this case Formal / _Fran√ßais formel_).

Let's try this sentence "_Je voudrais plut√¥t rester √† la maison que sortir_", "I would rather stay home than go out", and then click on "_Analyser le texte_".

As a result, we get the correct sentence and the original one with the typos highlighted.
